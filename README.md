# Calculator-
Here I have used do-while loop for user to perform n number of times and a switch case to choose the operation to perform and I have created seperate methods for each operation and printing the output and also in the division operations I have checked weather the denominator is 0 or not and if the division return the float value I have given the double data type to store it
